This project is a demo of how a french bill discussed at the National Assembly could be represented in a git repository.

We used the article 1 of the Hopital Bill discusted in 2009.

Thanks to this demo, we could [generate a gourse out of this repository](http://blog.lafabriquedelaloi.fr/OLDP/Presentations/1%20-%20Opening/Opening%20-%202%20-%20Regards%20Citoyens%20-%20LawIsCode%20-%20Video%20gource.php).

The [blame view](https://github.com/regardscitoyens/law-is-code-hopital-demo/blame/master/article_1/texte/article_1.txt) allows to retrive the MP in charge of the modification of each *Alin√©a*.
